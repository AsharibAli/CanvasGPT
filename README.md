## Project Overview

***CanvasGPT*** is a highly trained assistant that provides in-depth insights about the DSCVR Canvas. It answers queries with precision, making complex Canvas topics accessible to **newcomers, researchers, enthusiasts, and developers.** <br>

CanvasGPT assists developers in building apps on the DSCVR Platform through a conversational UI, powered by **Metaplex Core for NFT Generation as a authorization, OpenAI Assistants, GPT-4o model, and the latest tech-stack.** <br>

It helps developers code, fix, and test their canvas to build any type of applications within DSCVR Environment. Simply enter a prompt in the UI to get accurate answers. Specially designed for the DSCVR community of developers, CanvasGPT was developed by Asharib Ali as a submission for the **DSCVR Buildathon - Canvas Embedded Apps Fest** <br>

**CanvasGPT** offers many great features to help developers build and ship quickly on **DSCVR Platform.** <br>

## Problem Statement with Solution

Developers want to build different canvas apps but lack an interactive way to quickly and easily create any web2/web3 applications on the DSCVR Platform. They might use ChatGPT, but it's trained on outdated data and doesn't know about the latest developments (Like Canvas on DSCVR). Plus, GPT Plus costs $20 per month. That's why we need a specific assistant to address this issue: "Help developers write, fix, and test their canvas within the DSCVR Environment" in a conversational way. I have trained it on a good amount of data and have prompt-engineered it to achieve the best results, CanvasGPT is hosted on vercel with best CSP Policies and available on the DSCVR as a Canvas App.

## Features

To access the application, you need to mint an NFT (powered by Metaplex Core) on the Solana Devnet within the DSCVR Environment. Ensure you have Devnet SOL in your wallet. Switch to Devnet on Phantom or Solflare, mint authorization NFT and enjoy CanvasGPT.
