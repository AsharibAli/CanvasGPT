What is DSCVR?
With over half a million monthly unique visitors, DSCVR (pronounced “Discover”) combines the usability of a Web2-style social app with crypto technology that unlocks ownership, monetization and distribution for users, creators, and projects. Through its token-based features, DSCVR rewards users and supercharges community-building, while its API allows developers to build applications that target through the social graph, distribute through the feed, and monetize in posts. In the face of increasing frustration with Web2 social, DSCVR is bringing back openness, fairness, and optimism.

DSCVR Canvas
With the launch of DSCVR Canvas, a groundbreaking framework which enables any web app to be integrated in just a few steps and distributed to hundreds of thousands of DSCVR users, developers now have unprecedented opportunities to reach new audiences, enhance user experiences, and drive innovation within the web3 social ecosystem.

To get started building your own Canvas Application, check out the [Canvas Developer Guide)(https://docs.dscvr.one/build/dscvr-canvas/).

DSCVR API
DSCVR API lets developers access DSCVR’s rich social data and create your own social applications.

Social Primitives
DSCVR is built around three basic primitives that drive the user experience: Profiles, Portals, and Content. On an abstract level, you can look at Profiles and Portals simply as “folders” that Content can exist within.

Profiles
Profiles are the cornerstone of individual identity within the Web3 ecosystem. These profiles offer a blend of traditional social media functionality with blockchain-enabled features, including paired wallets and the ability to transfer tokens. Profiles are designed to be both a personal showcase and a gateway for other users to engage with them. User profiles develop unique social and interest graphs through their communities, connections, and engagement.

Portals
Portals serve as dedicated gateways to specific communities, projects, or topics. Like a Web3 subreddit or discord server, each portal is a hub where users can discover curated content, join discussions, and connect with others who share similar interests. Portals leverage blockchain technology to offer unique features such as token-gated access, NFT marketplaces, and community governance models, creating a versatile environment for community engagement and content discovery.

Content
At the heart of DSCVR is content, which spans a wide range of formats – from written posts and image galleries to videos and interactive dApps. Content exists within both posts and comments and is surfaced in profiles, portals, and feeds. A piece of content can be engaged with by viewing, reacting to, tipping, reporting, or sharing it, or by interacting with a Frame within it. DSCVR’s content architecture is designed to be flexible and interact seamlessly with on-chain data so that it can open up new distribution and monetization pathways for content creators.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


DSCVR API
DSCVR API provides access to DSCVR's SocialFi graph via a powerful and flexible GraphQL API. The API is designed to be easy to use and to provide all the information needed to build a wide range of applications on top of the DSCVR platform.

Learning GraphQL
If you're not already familiar with GraphQL please check out the GraphQL Introduction

GraphQL Clients
GraphQL requests can be performed using any HTTP client. Most of the examples in this document specify simple curl commands that can be run on the command-line. However, a GraphQL client library can make working with GraphQL APIs much easier by facilitating type-checking and autocompletion in an IDE.

The DSCVR team uses gql.tada, which facilitates working with TypeScript and GraphQL. However, there are many other libraries available for different languages and frameworks, and you're welcome to use the language and framework of your choice.

GraphQL Client Caching
We recommend disabling GraphQL client caching, at least during initial development, so that you can always get the latest data. This is especially crucial when polling for new data in response to user events; as GraphQL clients typically cache results for queries, so you may not see the latest data if caching is enabled.

Authentication
Currently, DSCVR API does not require authentication. Queries are made with the permissions of a logged out user. In the future authentication and rate-limiting mechanisms might be needed to scale the API.

Schema Version
While, GraphQL schema is version-less; in practice it's useful to communicate changes with a version when backwards-incompatible changes are made. The current version of the schema is 0.1.0.

Please note that this version of the DSCVR API should be considered alpha, and is subject to change.

Example Queries
Any of these queries can be run using curl. For example:

sh
curl 'https://api.dscvr.one/graphql' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, multipart/mixed' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{"query":"{ userByName(name: \"PopularDude99\") { id followingCount followerCount dscvrPoints }}"}'
Get a User by Username
The following request looks up a user by user name and returns the user's followingCount (the number of users a user is following), followerCount (the number of users following a user), dscvrPoints, and if the user is following another user with a specific id.

Request:

graphql
query {
  userByName(name: "PopularDude99") {
    id
    followingCount
    followerCount
    dscvrPoints
    isFollowing(userId:"slrjv-o4wlb-7mjt3-rjegb-psx7i-5ndvk-qkesi-ks3c3-mplfb-ort5m-bqe")
  }
}
Response:

json
{
  "data": {
    "userByName": {
      "id": "33tie-5rizy-elcap-bp5ke-jvrws-c5xib-bxpxi-anf74-aryfg-zlpe5-tqe",
      "followingCount": 93,
      "followerCount": 122,
      "dscvrPoints": "7370953305",
      "isFollowing": true
    }
  }
}
Get a User's Public Wallet Addresses
This request looks up a user by user name and returns the user's public wallet addresses, as well as other information such as the user's createdAt timestamp, dscvrPoints, and streak information.

Note: Only addresses that the user has chosen to make public to the API in the DSCVR Wallet Settings are returned. The isPrimary field indicates whether the wallet is the user's primary wallet.

Note: The public wallet addresses are base58 encoded.

Note: This specific query should be used for illustrative purposes only as this is a test account. However, the query should work in general for any user that has made their wallet addresses public.

Request:

graphql
query {
  userByName(name: "PopularDude007") {
    followerCount,
    createdAt,
    dscvrPoints
    streak {
      dayCount,
      multiplierCount
    }
    id
    wallets {
      address
      isPrimary
    }
  }
}
Response:

json

DSCVR Canvas Embedded Apps
DSCVR Canvas is a framework for building web applications, referred to as Canvases, that are embedded and distributed on DSCVR's platform.

Canvases can be built using familiar Web UI and server frameworks (Vue, React, Next.js, etc), and deployed on the infrastructure of your choice (Vercel, Heroku, Cloudflare, etc).

Once built, a Canvas can be easily distributed on DSCVR by embedding it in a post.

WARNING

DSCVR Canvas is currently in early preview. The UX, protocol, and tooling may change as the framework evolves and based on feedback from the development community.

Distribute a Canvas: Distribute a Canvas on DSCVR.
Security Model: Details of the security model for Canvas.
Design Guidelines: Design guidelines for Developers.
Examples: Examples of Canvases to jump-start your development.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Build a Canvas
Any Web Application can be easily made into a Canvas with just a few steps:

Add HTML meta tags:
html
<!-- Indicates that the application is a Canvas -->
<meta name="dscvr:canvas:version" content="vNext">
<!-- Open Graph Image for previewing the Canvas -->
<meta name="og:image" content="https://my-canvas.com/preview-image.png">
Setup a Content Security Policy if needed. A content security policy is necessary if the application accesses resources, scripts, or stylesheets from external URLs.

(Optional) Use the Canvas Client SDK to interact with the DSCVR frontend, and to get initial information about the user and the post that the Canvas is embedded in.

(Optional) Use DSCVR API to access DSCVR's social graph data. DSCVR API provides additional information about the user such as their follower graph, or the context that the app is embedded in like the portal. One use-case of DSCVR API is to perform conditional actions, for example when a user likes a post, or has a certain number of followers, etc.

(Optional) Follow the Design Guidelines to ensure your Canvas looks good.

Testing
There are two ways to test a Canvas:

In the Post Viewer:

Can be used if the Canvas does not query the post that it's embedded in. In this case, the Canvas can be tested in the post viewer without creating a new post by simply posting the URL.
In a post:

If your Canvas queries the post that it's embedded in (for example to check if the user liked the post), then the recommended practice is to create a test portal with view access for your development team and then follow the steps in Distribute a Canvas to create a new post with the Canvas embedded in it.
You may want to post a portal with limited view permissions so that the Canvas is not seen until it's ready.
Configuration for Development Servers
Frameworks like NextJS provide a development server that can be used to preview applications during development. The following additional steps are needed to use a development server to preview Canvas:

Setup a SSH tunnel to your local development server. For example, the following command can be used to setup a tunnel to a local server running on port 5173 using cloudflared:
bash
npx cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:5173
Override Content Security Policy for the development server. The following configuration file describes the configuration needed for NextJS. A similar approach can be used for other frameworks.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Distribute A Canvas
A Canvas can be distributed by embeddeding it in a post:

Click the “+” button in the top right corner of your screen to create a new post.
In the dropdown menu at the top of the post editor, choose which Portal you would like to post your Canvas to (you can explore Portals here), or keep the default selection to post to your own Profile.
Paste your Canvas URL into the post editor and your Canvas will appear below it.
Add any other text, media, or memes you’d like to have in your Canvas post.
Click Post, and admire your awesome new DSCVR post featuring a Canvas. 🖼️

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Canvas Client SDK
The Client SDK package can be used to interact with the DSCVR frontend. Some features provided by the SDK are:

Accessing user and post information
Performing transactions on the Solana blockchain
Opening external links in a safe way
Using the SDK
Install the Client SDK package
bash
npm install @dscvr-one/canvas-client-sdk
Add application logic to start the handshake with the host:
typescript
import { CanvasInterface, CanvasClient } from '@dscvr-one/canvas-client-sdk';

const canvasClient = new CanvasClient();
const response = await canvasClient.ready();

if (response) {
    // The handshake allows access to the user and the content that the application is embedded in.
    const user: CanvasInterface.Handshake.User = response.untrusted.user;
    const content: CanvasInterface.Handshake.Content = response.untrusted.content;
    // ...
}
Please see the [SDK documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@dscvr-one/canvas-client-sdk) and [examples](https://github.com/dscvr-one/dscvr-canvas/tree/main/examples) for more information on how to use the available functionality.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design Guidelines
The guidelines are provided to ensure that the application looks good when embedded in DSCVR and also other considerations to keep in mind when designing Canvas Applications.

Styling Guidelines
Applications need to specify a background color. The default background is #0C0F14.
The aspect aspect ratio is taken from the preview image. If the preview image is not not present then 1.91/1 is used for the aspect ratio.
Canvas width is 100% of the container, but height can change with the resize request
Scroll is handled in the host after 1200px, so the canvas be mindful if canvas shows other scrolls
Other Considerations
Applications cannot launch popups. However, external links can be opened using a method provided in the SDK. This mechanism allows the user to confirm that they want to navigate to the external URL.
Applications cannot navigate away from the original URL.
All resources must be served over HTTPS.
Applications cannot embed other iframes.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Canvas Security
To protect users, application developers and the DSCVR platform, Canvases are run in a sandboxed iframe with a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).

In order to enforce a standard CSP for all Canvases, DSCVR routes the initial Canvas traffic through a proxy. This is done by mapping the Canvas's subdomain to a DSCVR-controlled subdomain. The proxy then adds the standard CSP to the response headers.

Customizing the Content Security Policy
Canvases that access resources, scripts, or stylesheets from external URLs need to specify these URLs in the CSP policy. This is necessary to ensure that the Canvas can access the resources it needs while maintaining the security of the DSCVR platform.

DSCVR allows Canvases to provide their own CSP policy for the following CSP directives:

script-src
style-src
img-src
font-src
connect-src
media-src
Please note that values such as unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval are not allowed in the CSP. However, to support WASM, wasm-unsafe-eval is allowed. Inlined scripts and styles can be used via a nonce. CSP directives can be modified by the application to specify additional https URLs that the application needs to access. DSCVR will merge the CSP sent from your application server with the standard CSP.

DSCVR on a case by case basis can allow exceptions to the above CSP rules.
